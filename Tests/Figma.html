                Crack your mind and show us its strength at the Chess event!!
                Chess, one of the oldest and most popular board games, played by two opponents on a checkered board with specially designed pieces of contrasting colours, commonly white and black. The object of the game is to checkmate the opponent's king, whereby the king is under immediate attack and there is no way for it to escape.</span><span class="v14_52">Chess</span></div>
